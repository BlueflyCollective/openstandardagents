# Welcome to OSSA

We're excited to announce the release of **OSSA (Open Standard for Scalable AI Agents)** - the OpenAPI for AI Agents.

This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI agent development. Just as OpenAPI revolutionized how we define and document REST APIs, OSSA brings the same level of standardization and interoperability to the world of AI agents. No longer will developers be locked into proprietary frameworks or forced to rewrite agents when switching platforms. With OSSA, you can define your agent once and deploy it anywhere.

## What is OSSA?

OSSA is a specification standard for defining AI agents, similar to how OpenAPI standardizes REST APIs. Just as OpenAPI enables API interoperability, OSSA enables agent interoperability across frameworks, runtimes, and organizations.

## Key Features

- **Framework-agnostic** - Works with any LLM framework
- **Portable** - Move agents between teams and organizations
- **Validatable** - JSON Schema validation ensures correctness
- **No vendor lock-in** - Deploy to any infrastructure

## Get Started

Install the OSSA CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @bluefly/openstandardagents
```

Create your first agent:

```bash
osa init my-agent --type worker
```
