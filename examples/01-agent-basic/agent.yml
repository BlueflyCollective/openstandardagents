# OAAS Agent Basic - Level 1 (Target: 30 lines)
# OpenAPI AI Agents Standard - Educational Example
# ==============================================================================
# Purpose: Learn OAAS fundamentals in 5 minutes
# Use Case: Quick prototypes, learning, simple single-purpose agents
# Next Level: When you need API specs or production features, see 02-agent-integration
# ==============================================================================

# REQUIRED: Agent identifier - must be unique within your workspace
# Format: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no spaces or underscores)
# Example: "code-analyzer", "test-generator", "doc-writer"
name: example-basic

# REQUIRED: Semantic version (major.minor.patch)
# Start with 0.1.0 for new agents, 1.0.0 for production
version: "1.0.0"

# REQUIRED: One-line description of what this agent specializes in
# This is used by discovery engines to understand agent expertise
expertise: "Basic agent demonstrating core OAAS features"

# OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED: Detailed description
# Helps other developers and AI systems understand your agent's purpose
description: |
  A simple agent showing the minimum viable configuration for a useful
  OAAS agent with framework compatibility and clear capabilities.

# REQUIRED: List of things this agent can do
# Format: capability_name: "Human-readable description"
# Best Practice: Use verb_noun format (analyze_code, generate_tests, validate_data)
# These capabilities are discovered and matched when routing requests
capabilities:
  - analyze_code: "Analyzes code quality and structure"
  - generate_docs: "Creates documentation from code"
  - validate_syntax: "Checks syntax errors and formatting"
  - suggest_improvements: "Recommends code improvements"

# RECOMMENDED: Paths the agent can access for context
# These paths are relative to where the agent is deployed
# The discovery engine uses these to understand what resources the agent needs
context_paths:
  - path: ./src
    description: "Source code directory"
  - path: ./docs
    description: "Documentation files"
  - path: ./tests
    description: "Test files"

# RECOMMENDED: Framework compatibility declarations
# Only enable frameworks you actually plan to integrate with
# Setting enabled: true makes this agent discoverable by that framework
frameworks:
  mcp: enabled        # Works with Claude Desktop via MCP
  langchain: enabled  # Can be used as a LangChain tool
  crewai: enabled    # Can participate in CrewAI workflows

# OPTIONAL: API endpoints this agent exposes
# If specified, the agent should implement these endpoints
# For Level 2+, these would be defined in an OpenAPI spec
api_endpoints:
  - /analyze
  - /generate
  - /validate

# ==============================================================================
# What You've Learned:
# 1. Every agent needs: name, version, expertise, and capabilities
# 2. Capabilities should have clear descriptions for discovery
# 3. Framework declarations enable automatic integration
# 4. Context paths tell the system what resources you need
#
# Next Steps:
# - Validate this agent: oaas validate agent.yml
# - Test discovery: oaas scan (should find this agent)
# - Upgrade to Level 2: Add OpenAPI spec and enhanced framework configs
