# OAAS Agent Basic - Level 1 (Target: 30 lines)
# OpenAPI AI Agents Standard - Educational Example
# ==============================================================================
# Purpose: Learn OAAS fundamentals in 5 minutes
# Use Case: Quick prototypes, learning, simple single-purpose agents
# Next Level: When you need API specs or production features, see 02-agent-integration
# ==============================================================================

# REQUIRED: OpenAPI AI Agents Standard specification
apiVersion: openapi-ai-agents/v0.1.1
kind: Agent

# REQUIRED: Agent metadata - identity and version information
metadata:
  # Agent identifier - must be unique within your workspace
  # Format: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no spaces or underscores)
  name: example-basic
  
  # Semantic version (major.minor.patch)
  # Start with 0.1.0 for new agents, 1.0.0 for production  
  version: "1.0.0"
  
  # Optional but recommended: Detailed description
  description: |
    A simple agent showing the minimum viable configuration for a useful
    OAAS agent with framework compatibility and clear capabilities.

# REQUIRED: Agent specification - capabilities and behavior
spec:
  # Agent expertise - one-line description of what this agent specializes in
  # This is used by discovery engines to understand agent expertise
  agent:
    name: example-basic
    expertise: "Basic agent demonstrating core OAAS features"

  # REQUIRED: List of things this agent can do
  # Format: name + description for each capability
  # Best Practice: Use verb_noun format (analyze_code, generate_tests, validate_data)
  capabilities:
    - name: analyze_code
      description: "Analyzes code quality and structure"
    - name: generate_docs  
      description: "Creates documentation from code"
    - name: validate_syntax
      description: "Checks syntax errors and formatting"
    - name: suggest_improvements
      description: "Recommends code improvements"

  # RECOMMENDED: Framework compatibility declarations
  # Only enable frameworks you actually plan to integrate with
  # Setting enabled: true makes this agent discoverable by that framework
  frameworks:
    mcp:
      enabled: true    # Works with Claude Desktop via MCP
    langchain:
      enabled: true    # Can be used as a LangChain tool
    crewai:
      enabled: true    # Can participate in CrewAI workflows

# ==============================================================================
# What You've Learned:
# 1. Every agent needs: name, version, expertise, and capabilities
# 2. Capabilities should have clear descriptions for discovery
# 3. Framework declarations enable automatic integration
# 4. Context paths tell the system what resources you need
#
# Next Steps:
# - Validate this agent: oaas validate agent.yml
# - Test discovery: oaas scan (should find this agent)
# - Upgrade to Level 2: Add OpenAPI spec and enhanced framework configs
